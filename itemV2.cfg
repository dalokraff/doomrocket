description = "The ingineous craftman of Clan Skryre have developed a device to bring explosive death from afar. Clan Fester has been granted the privlege of field testing the new Warprockets, and the Ubersreik Five will make for excellent target practice.

Use the chat command \"/doom\" to toggle Warprocket Bombardiers in your game.
All players will need to have the mod in order to play together but only the host will be able to toggle Bombardiers spawning.

Currently only the gameplay mechanics are near a complete state. The mesh, textures, animations and sound assets are still a WIP.
