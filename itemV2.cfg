Use the chat command "/doom" to toggle Warprocket Bombardiers in your game.
All players will need to have the mod in order to play together but only the host will be able to toggle Bombardiers spawning.

Currently only the gameplay mechanics are near a complete state. The mesh, textures, animations and sound assets are still a WIP.
